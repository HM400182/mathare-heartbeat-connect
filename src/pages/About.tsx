                <p>
                  The Ghetto Foundation emerged from a deep understanding that lasting change 
                  comes from within communities themselves. Founded by residents and supporters 
                  who believed in the untapped potential of Mathare, we began as a grassroots 
                  movement focused on education and community empowerment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, we've grown into a comprehensive organization that addresses 
                  multiple facets of community development - from vocational training and 
                  digital literacy to research and civic education. Our approach remains 
                  unchanged: listen to the community, research the challenges, and implement 
                  solutions together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we continue to evolve, always guided by the voices and needs of 
                  the people we serve. Every program, every initiative, and every decision 
                  reflects our commitment to community-led development.

            At the heart of our methodology is CLRA - an approach that ensures community

            in identifying challenges and developing solutions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
            This participatory approach means that every program we implement is grounded 
            in real community needs, backed by local research, and designed for sustainability 
            by the very people it serves.
